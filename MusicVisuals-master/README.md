# Description of the assignment
Assignment Brief: In this creative coding team project, you will work in a team of up to four, to create an abstract visual story of a song. You will use Processing, Minim or the Processing Sound library to create audio responsive elements and Github to manage your project. You will create a program that responds to the audio of a chosen song and generates a visually compelling and abstract representation of the song's mood, tempo, and structure.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
