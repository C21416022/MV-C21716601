# Description of the assignment
Assignment Brief: In this creative coding team project, you will work in a team of up to four, to create an abstract visual story of a song. You will use Processing, Minim or the Processing Sound library to create audio responsive elements and Github to manage your project. You will create a program that responds to the audio of a chosen song and generates a visually compelling and abstract representation of the song's mood, tempo, and structure. The program should showcase your teamwork, creativity, technical skills, and ability to effectively communicate emotions and narrative through visual elements.

# What We am most proud of in the assignment
What we are most proud of is how we were able to work as a group and develop cool visualisations. We are especially proud of case 5



This is the code we used to switch between the visuals. We decided to use a switch statement as we believe it is efficient and simple to code.

```Java
  switch(v)
        {
            case 1:
            {
                bakht.render();
                break;
            }

            case 2:
            {

                er.render();
                er1.render();

                break;
            }

            case 3:
            {
                
                nico.render();
                break;
            }

            case 4:
            {
            
                visual6.render();

                break;
            }

            case 5:
            {

                us1.render();
                us.render();

                break;
            }


        }
```
